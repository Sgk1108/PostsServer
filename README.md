# POSTS DISPLAY SERVER
It is similar to one of my repo (ie. Small_web_server),we used "uuidv4()" from npm website to generate random id's by installing the package through a specific command in terminal (v4 means version 4) 
we even used "method_override" to access patch, delete requests (as we only had access to get and post request)
